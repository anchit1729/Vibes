# Vibes

Final project code for CS889 - Human Computer Interaction for Art and Creativity

Vibes is a design tool installation that allows users to generate vibrations using mid-air gesture-based interaction and feel them through a simple box-shaped device. It includes interactive visualizations for primitive waveforms, AM and FM synthesis, and envelope editing. Over time, saved user-generated vibrations persist in the background of the interface. Refer to the [pictorial](https://github.com/anchit1729/Vibes/blob/main/pictorial.pdf) and [video walkthrough](https://youtu.be/5yFQNiPIUQ0) for more details.

To run the project, simply fire up the p5.js live server. Make sure your webcam is recognized by your web browser (Vibes has primarily been tested on Safari, but should also work on Chrome), and that ml5.js models are working properly (check for any CORS errors!). To try out haptics, you will need to connect a haptic actuator to the audio output of your computer; this can either be using a 3.5mm cable connection to an amplifier, or over Bluetooth. In the absence of a haptic device, you should still be able to hear the vibrations as audio. Warning: do not wear headphones, since the audio can get quite loud!
