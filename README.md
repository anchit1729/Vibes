# Vibes

Final project code for CS889 - Human Computer Interaction for Art and Creativity

Vibes is a design tool installation that allows users to generate vibrations using mid-air gesture-based interaction and feel them through a simple box-shaped device. It includes interactive visualizations for primitive waveforms, AM and FM synthesis, and envelope editing. Over time, saved user-generated vibrations persist in the background of the interface. Refer to the project pictorial and video for more details.
